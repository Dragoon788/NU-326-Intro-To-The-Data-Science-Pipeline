# Introduction to the Data Science Pipeline

[[Github Repository]](https://github.com/drc-cs/winter25-cs326/)

This course aims to cover data science theory and tools for obtaining, cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and interpreting data. Most of the tools introduced in this course will be based on Python, although the theory can be applied to any programming language. Ethical data science will be consistently reinforced. As an outcome of this course, students should be able to independently derive insights from real-life datasets.

## Homework

Homeworks are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lecture. They will be a mix of theoretical and practical problems. If there is time, we will work on homework at the end of every lecture as a group.

- **Due**: Homework due dates are posted in the syllabus.

- **Late Policy**: Late homeworks will lose 1 out of 10 points per day (1% of your final grade).

- **Platform**: A submission script has been provided to submit your homeworks.

- **Collaboration**: You are encouraged to work with your peers on homeworks. However, you must submit your own work. Copying and pasting code from other sources will be detected and penalized.

| Homework | Due Date | Description |

## Midterm

There will be a midterm exam covering the content from the first half of the course. It will include both theoretical and practical components.

------

## Final

There will be one quiz towards the end of this course. The quiz will cover the theoretical and practical concepts covered in the lectures and homeworks. If you follow along with the lectures and homeworks, you will be well-prepared for the final exam.
